<!-- How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
I feel somewhat confident. I just need more practice, as it is still very new to me.

Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
Boolean arrays are a little weird to me, because there are only two possible values that their elements can have. I might do a little research about them.

What questions do you have about Arrays?
I would like more practice regarding Boolean arrays.
